This repo is for Phaser 3 related issues only. If you've found an issue with Phaser 2 please see the [Phaser CE (Community Edition)](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) repo instead.

This should not be used for technical support. If you're struggling trying to use Phaser then post your question to the [forum](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/33-phaser-3/), [Slack](https://phaser.io/community/slack) or [Discord](https://phaser.io/community/discord) channels. GitHub Issues are for bugs and feature requests only.

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_. Feel free to use a site such as jsBin or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen?template=YeEWom) to demo the problem. If we can run it, and see the error, we can usually fix it.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed and you will be blocked from access to all our repos.

**Be nice. We do this for free.**
